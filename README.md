Overview: This is a personal project where I created a Golf Simulator in C to test my programming skills, inspired by a popular 2010 video game. The completion time was about two weeks.

Components Included: Framework for various golf holes, Club selection, Scoring system and total overall score

Programing Concepts Used: Variable declaration and initialization, while loops and do-while loops, If/else blocks and switches, Arrays, Pointers and function pointers, macros, header files

Code Quality Goals: Efficient, well organized, and professional readability

Strategies used for clarity: Proper indentation, Structured functions and blocks, Camel case naming conventions, Minimizing nesting of code blocks

File Information:
The main branch includes the golfSimulator.c file, which serves as the main C file to be executed. The golfClubs.h file contains the code for the golf clubs. This header file was created specifically to handle the code related to the golf clubs. This ensures better organization for the project. Including all the club-related code in the main file would have made it less organized, especially given the number of clubs involved in the project.
