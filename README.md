# Overview
This is a personal project where I created a Golf Simulator program in C to test my C programming skills after completing the course, C for Engineers. I was inspired by several videos games that had golf as a minigame, and I wanted to create a basic version of golf with a CLI. The completion time was about two weeks.

## Components Included
- Framework for various golf holes
- Club selection
- Scoring system
- Total overall score

## Programing Concepts Used
- Variable declaration and initialization
- While loops and do-while loops
- Conditional statements like if/else blocks and switches
- Arrays
- Pointers
- Macros
- Header files

## Code Quality Goals
- Efficient
- Well organized
- Professional readability

## Strategies used for clarity
- Proper indentation
- Structured functions and blocks
- Camel case naming conventions
- Minimizing nesting of code blocks

## File Information:
The main branch includes the golfSimulator.c file, which serves as the main C file to be executed. The golfClubs.h file contains the code for the golf clubs. This header file was created specifically to handle the code related to the golf clubs. This ensures better organization for the project. Including all the club-related code in the main file would have made it less organized, especially given the number of clubs involved in the project.
